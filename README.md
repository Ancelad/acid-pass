# acid-pass
Acid-pass (pronounced "SSID"-pass) is a Sailfish application to show your stored Wi-Fi password.

**Warning**
It takes root privileges to find the passwords. This can be misused if someone else gets access to your device!
The access code should prevent unauthorised use of the application itself by others. It has some other basic protections to make it a little bit harder to abuse it.
In short: use at own risk.
